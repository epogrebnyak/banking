# Understanding Banking

Last revision: February 4, 2020

## Who is the reader?

Anyone who wants to make sense of banks, loans and debt markets data.

## What is wrong with empirical banking studies?

On entry there are plenty of open courses, news commentary and data on financial markets and banking, yet understanding of how banks work and how to trace thier work with data is very limited. [Why so?](unhappy.md)

## Why bother a new textbook with code and data?

Would want to have one I would have liked myself. 
And there isn't that much open code and relevant data in banking.

## Proposed structure

Part 1: Concepts and evidence

- How banks work? (balance sheet, business processes and valuation)
- How banks fail? (2008 and other failures)
- How banks are regulated?
- How banks change? (payments innovation, neobanks, ecosystems, financial marketplaces)

Part 2: Data and code

## Intended format

- presentation as slides with comments
- extending a concept as a minimal mind model to more realistic cases
- runnable code (Python) with open data

## Work in progress

- [credit risk mindmap](https://github.com/epogrebnyak/banking/issues/1)
- understanding the balance sheet
