# Understanding Banking

Last revision: February 4, 2020

## Who is the reader?

Anyone who wants to make sense of banks, loans and debt markets data.

## What is wrong with empiric banking studies?

On entry there are plenty of open courses, news commentary and data on financial markets and banking, yet understanding of how banks work and how to trace thier work with data is very limited. [Why so?](unhappy.md)

- Reason one - textbooks live in own space and empiric evidence and problems in another space that overlap casually. 
- Reason two - bank regulation has grown in sophistication, but not necessarilty in impactfulness; few reules are easy and working as they should. 
- Reason three - there is a complexity bias is academia and in teaching - not enough rewards to present topics in straightforward, approachable way. "Mathyness" is a special kind of bias with excessive use of math without a touch to the the data, or at times 
even reality. 
- Reason four - realistic granular bank data like portfolio composition is scarce and we need more proper disclosure of it, perhaps as 
synthetic data. 
- Reason five - lack of reproducibility in research.
- Reason six - banks are under a lot pressures to transform, many times this is a distressed, not a flourishing business. Banks failed us in 2008, so credibility not on their side either.

## Why bother a new textbook with code and data?

Would want to have one I would have liked myself. 

## Proposed structure for the workbook:

Part 1: Concepts and evidence

- How banks work? (balance sheet, business processes and valuation)
- How banks fail? (2008 and other failures)
- How banks are regulated?
- How banks change? (payments innovation, neobanks, ecosystems, financial marketplaces)

Part 2: Data and code

## Intended format:

- presentation as slides with comments
- extending a concept as a minimal mind model to more realistic cases
- runnable code (Python) with open data

## Work in progress

- [credit risk mindmap](https://github.com/epogrebnyak/banking/issues/1)
- understanding the balance sheet
